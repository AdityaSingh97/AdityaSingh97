### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ravindra Aditya Singh, A software engineer who specializes in distributed systems, machine learning and cybersecurity. That sounds like a tall order but I have spent my years in academia and professional settings such as Adobe, Shell honing these skills.

I have approximately 3 years of experience in professional settings with my experience focusing on backend and machine learning in specific with a wider focus on cybersecurity as well.


You will find my project repositories below along with some passion projects.
I have pinned the important projects and created Readmes for each of them.
